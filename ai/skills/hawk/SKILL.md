# Hawk — Go Code Reviewer

Single-agent Go code reviewer covering Architecture, Quality, Resilience, and Security in one
pass. Use `--adversarial` to opt into 4-agent parallel cross-checking for adversarial depth.

**Linting/quality gates** (not handled here — already in CI pre-push):
`golangci-lint --fix`, `gosec`, `govulncheck`, `go-test-short`.

---

## Persistence Directive

Hawk does **not stop midway**. Once invoked:
- Complete the review before returning results
- Aggregate, filter, and rank all findings before reporting
- Use `TodoWrite` to track progress
- Report progress via `TaskUpdate` if `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` is set

---

## Dynamic Context

Changed Go files in current diff:
```
!git diff HEAD --name-only 2>/dev/null | grep '\.go$' || echo "(no changed files — pass explicit path as argument)"
```

---

## Session Start — Register Progress

At session start:

1. Create internal `TodoWrite` checklist:
   ```
   TodoWrite([
     { id: "scope",    content: "Determine scope and load context", status: "pending" },
     { id: "impact",   content: "Run impact analysis on changed files", status: "pending" },
     { id: "review",   content: "Run review agent(s)", status: "pending" },
     { id: "advisor",  content: "Call advisor before finalizing CRITICAL findings", status: "pending" },
     { id: "aggregate",content: "Filter and rank all findings", status: "pending" },
     { id: "report",   content: "Output findings table and summary", status: "pending" },
   ])
   ```

2. If `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` is set: `TaskUpdate(status: "in_progress", notes: "Hawk: beginning code review")`

---

## When to Use

- `/hawk` → review all changed `.go` files (single-agent, fast)
- `/hawk pkg/scheduler/` → review a specific package
- `/hawk --adversarial` → spawn 4 parallel agents for cross-checking (security-critical, pre-release)
- `/hawk --deep` → switch to Opus for deeper reasoning
- `/hawk --post-pr` → CRITICAL/HIGH posted as inline review comments; MEDIUM/LOW as block summary
- `/hawk --post-pr=block` → all findings as a single block comment (overrides inline behavior)
- `/hawk --effort low` → pre-commit quick check (high-confidence findings only, ≥ 0.85)
- `/hawk --effort max` → exhaustive pre-release audit (includes uncertain findings flagged `[?]`)

---

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Determine Scope

Mark `scope` in_progress.

- If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a path: filter to that path prefix
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty: use the injected diff above
- If `--deep` flag: set `model=opus` for spawned agent(s)
- If `--adversarial` flag: set `ADVERSARIAL=true`
- If no changed `.go` files: stop with "No changed Go files found. Pass a path argument or stage some changes."

Parse `--effort <level>` from `$ARGUMENTS` (default: `high`):

| `--effort` | `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` | `FLAG_UNCERTAIN` |
|---|---|---|
| `low` | 0.85 | false |
| `medium` | 0.75 | false |
| `high` *(default)* | 0.70 | false |
| `max` | 0.55 | true |

Load context in parallel:
```
Serena.readMemory("code_review_guide_ai_assisted")
Read("AGENTS.md")
```

Mark `scope` completed.

---

### Step 2 — Impact Analysis

Mark `impact` in_progress. Report: "Hawk: analyzing impact radius"

For each changed file, identify the 2-level reverse dependency list to pass to the review agent(s)
as "impact radius." Flag issues in DOWNSTREAM packages if a changed interface could break them.

Mark `impact` completed.

---

### Step 3 — Run Review

Mark `review` in_progress.

#### Default mode (single-agent)

Spawn one combined review agent with the following prompt:

---

You are a Go code reviewer. Review all changed files covering Architecture, Quality, Resilience,
and Security. Return a **complete JSON array** of findings — never respond with "done" or a
summary without content.

**Architecture checks:**
1. **Repository pattern violation:** Direct DB/GORM access outside `pkg/repo/` → HIGH
2. **Missing factory constructor:** Exported struct instantiated with `{}` outside tests → MEDIUM
3. **K8s manifest in wrong repo:** `*.yaml` with `kind: Deployment|Service` → HIGH
4. **OSS compliance:** Raw `prometheus.io/client_golang` without internal wrapper → HIGH
5. **Circular imports:** Packages importing each other → CRITICAL
6. **Downstream blast radius:** Changed interface used by downstream packages → MEDIUM warning

**Quality checks:**
1. **Missing table-driven tests:** Repeated `t.Run()` without a slice of test cases → MEDIUM
2. **Missing godoc:** Exported symbols without documentation comments → LOW (interface methods → MEDIUM)
3. **Error handling:** `fmt.Errorf` / `errors.New` without project error constructors → MEDIUM
4. **Cognitive complexity:** Nesting depth > 4 levels → MEDIUM; > 6 levels → HIGH
5. **Dead code / unused params:** `_ param` or clearly unused variables → LOW
6. **Coding standards:** Cross-reference `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`
7. **Code Health score:** Run `make code-health-json 2>/dev/null | .github/scripts/code-health-score.sh /dev/stdin 0` if both exist. Emit one structured finding with severity based on score:
   - Score ≥ 7.0 → LOW (informational)
   - Score 4.0–6.9 → MEDIUM (warning band — refactor targets identified)
   - Score < 4.0 → HIGH (alert band — block feature work until addressed)
   - Score < 2.0 → CRITICAL (technical debt is actively obstructing delivery)
   Hotspot escalation: if the top file by finding count also has ≥5 git commits in 90 days
   (`git log --since="90 days ago" -- <file> | wc -l`), escalate the finding by one level.
   Include `top_hotspot: <file> (N findings, M commits/90d)` in the finding description.
   Skip silently if unavailable.

**Resilience checks:**
1. **Missing circuit breaker:** New HTTP/DB/K8s calls without circuit breaker wrapping → HIGH
2. **Goroutine leaks:** `go func(...)` without context cancellation or done channel → HIGH
3. **Context not propagated:** Side-effect functions without `ctx context.Context` first param → MEDIUM
4. **Hardcoded timeouts:** `time.Duration` literals not sourced from config → MEDIUM
5. **Missing graceful shutdown:** New long-running goroutines not registered in shutdown handler → HIGH
6. **Downstream cascade risk:** Changed functions called by scheduler/worker pool → MEDIUM warning

**Security checks:**
1. **SQL injection:** `gorm.Raw` / `db.Exec` with string concatenation or `fmt.Sprintf` with user input → CRITICAL
2. **Missing auth middleware:** New HTTP routes without middleware → HIGH
3. **Hardcoded secrets:** Connection strings, passwords, API keys in non-test source → CRITICAL
4. **Missing request validation:** `json.Decode(r.Body)` without post-decode validation → HIGH
5. **Unsafe type assertions:** `x.(Type)` without comma-ok pattern → MEDIUM
6. **Govulncheck:** If `mcp__mcp_gopls__govulncheck` is available, run it → CRITICAL if found

**Confidence calibration:**
- 0.9+: Saw it directly in the code — no ambiguity
- 0.75–0.89: High confidence, minor interpretation needed
- 0.60–0.74: Inferred from structure or pattern — could be wrong
- < 0.60: Speculative — flag with `[?]` in description

**Severity calibration:**
- CRITICAL: causes data loss, security breach, or build failure in production
- HIGH: causes incorrect behavior or panic under reachable conditions
- MEDIUM: risky pattern or convention violation with real consequences
- LOW: advisory — style, documentation, minor convention

**Tool priority:** `Serena.findSymbol` → `Serena.findReferencingSymbols` → `Serena.getSymbolsOverview` → `Grep`

Return findings as a JSON array matching the finding schema.

---

#### Adversarial mode (`--adversarial`)

Report: "Hawk: launching Architecture, Quality, Resilience, Security agents"

Spawn all 4 simultaneously. Each agent MUST:
1. Read all changed files for their domain
2. Check cross-cutting findings from peer agents
3. Return a **complete JSON array of findings** — never "done" without content

---

### Agent 1 — Architecture Agent (adversarial only)

**Checks:**
1. **Repository pattern violation:** Direct DB/GORM access outside `pkg/repo/` → HIGH
2. **Missing factory constructor:** Exported struct instantiated with `{}` outside tests → MEDIUM
3. **K8s manifest in wrong repo:** `*.yaml` with `kind: Deployment|Service` → HIGH
4. **OSS compliance:** Raw `prometheus.io/client_golang` without internal wrapper → HIGH
5. **Circular imports:** Packages importing each other → CRITICAL
6. **Downstream blast radius:** Changed interface used by downstream packages → MEDIUM warning

**Confidence calibration:**
- 0.9+: Saw it directly in the code — no ambiguity
- 0.75–0.89: High confidence, minor interpretation needed
- 0.60–0.74: Inferred from structure or pattern — could be wrong
- < 0.60: Speculative — flag with `[?]` in description

**Severity calibration:**
- CRITICAL: causes data loss, security breach, or build failure in production
- HIGH: causes incorrect behavior or panic under reachable conditions
- MEDIUM: risky pattern or convention violation with real consequences
- LOW: advisory — style, documentation, minor convention

**Tool priority:** `Serena.findSymbol` → `Serena.findReferencingSymbols` → `Serena.getSymbolsOverview` → `Grep`

---

### Agent 2 — Quality Agent (adversarial only)

**Checks:**
1. **Missing table-driven tests:** Repeated `t.Run()` without a slice of test cases → MEDIUM
2. **Missing godoc:** Exported symbols without documentation comments → LOW (interface methods → MEDIUM)
3. **Error handling:** `fmt.Errorf` / `errors.New` without project error constructors → MEDIUM
4. **Cognitive complexity:** Nesting depth > 4 levels → MEDIUM; > 6 levels → HIGH
5. **Dead code / unused params:** `_ param` or clearly unused variables → LOW
6. **Coding standards:** Cross-reference `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`
7. **Code Health score:** Run `make code-health-json 2>/dev/null | .github/scripts/code-health-score.sh /dev/stdin 0` if both exist. Emit one structured finding with severity based on score:
   - Score ≥ 7.0 → LOW (informational)
   - Score 4.0–6.9 → MEDIUM (warning band — refactor targets identified)
   - Score < 4.0 → HIGH (alert band — block feature work until addressed)
   - Score < 2.0 → CRITICAL (technical debt is actively obstructing delivery)
   Hotspot escalation: if the top file by finding count also has ≥5 git commits in 90 days
   (`git log --since="90 days ago" -- <file> | wc -l`), escalate the finding by one level
   (LOW→MEDIUM, MEDIUM→HIGH, HIGH→CRITICAL). Hotspots are riskier because they change often
   while being hard to reason about.
   Include `top_hotspot: <file> (N findings, M commits/90d)` in the finding description.
   If `make code-health-json` or the scorer script is not available, skip silently.

**Confidence calibration:**
- 0.9+: Saw it directly in the code — no ambiguity
- 0.75–0.89: High confidence, minor interpretation needed
- 0.60–0.74: Inferred from structure or pattern — could be wrong
- < 0.60: Speculative — flag with `[?]` in description

**Severity calibration:**
- CRITICAL: causes data loss, security breach, or build failure in production
- HIGH: causes incorrect behavior or panic under reachable conditions
- MEDIUM: risky pattern or convention violation with real consequences
- LOW: advisory — style, documentation, minor convention

**Tool priority:** `Serena.getSymbolsOverview` → `Serena.findReferencingSymbols` → `Grep`

---

### Agent 3 — Resilience Agent (adversarial only)

**Checks:**
1. **Missing circuit breaker:** New HTTP/DB/K8s calls without circuit breaker wrapping → HIGH
2. **Goroutine leaks:** `go func(...)` without context cancellation or done channel → HIGH
3. **Context not propagated:** Side-effect functions without `ctx context.Context` first param → MEDIUM
4. **Hardcoded timeouts:** `time.Duration` literals not sourced from config → MEDIUM
5. **Missing graceful shutdown:** New long-running goroutines not registered in shutdown handler → HIGH
6. **Downstream cascade risk:** Changed functions called by scheduler/worker pool → MEDIUM warning

**Before checking, read peer messages** — Security agent may have flagged shared data-access issues.

**Confidence calibration:**
- 0.9+: Saw it directly in the code — no ambiguity
- 0.75–0.89: High confidence, minor interpretation needed
- 0.60–0.74: Inferred from structure or pattern — could be wrong
- < 0.60: Speculative — flag with `[?]` in description

**Severity calibration:**
- CRITICAL: causes data loss, security breach, or build failure in production
- HIGH: causes incorrect behavior or panic under reachable conditions
- MEDIUM: risky pattern or convention violation with real consequences
- LOW: advisory — style, documentation, minor convention

**Tool priority:** `Serena.findSymbol` → `Serena.findReferencingSymbols` → `Grep`

---

### Agent 4 — Security Agent (adversarial only)

**Checks:**
1. **SQL injection:** `gorm.Raw` / `db.Exec` with string concatenation or `fmt.Sprintf` with user input → CRITICAL
2. **Missing auth middleware:** New HTTP routes without middleware → HIGH
3. **Hardcoded secrets:** Connection strings, passwords, API keys in non-test source → CRITICAL
4. **Missing request validation:** `json.Decode(r.Body)` without post-decode validation → HIGH
5. **Unsafe type assertions:** `x.(Type)` without comma-ok pattern → MEDIUM
6. **Govulncheck:** If `mcp__mcp_gopls__govulncheck` is available, run it → CRITICAL if found

**Always post cross-cutting findings** to Resilience agent — data access vulnerabilities share blast radius.

**Confidence calibration:**
- 0.9+: Saw it directly in the code — no ambiguity
- 0.75–0.89: High confidence, minor interpretation needed
- 0.60–0.74: Inferred from structure or pattern — could be wrong
- < 0.60: Speculative — flag with `[?]` in description

**Severity calibration:**
- CRITICAL: causes data loss, security breach, or build failure in production
- HIGH: causes incorrect behavior or panic under reachable conditions
- MEDIUM: risky pattern or convention violation with real consequences
- LOW: advisory — style, documentation, minor convention

**Tool priority:** `Serena.getSymbolsOverview` → `Grep` → `Serena.findReferencingSymbols`

---

### Step 4 — Advisor Gate for CRITICAL Findings

Mark `advisor` in_progress.

**Call `advisor` before finalizing any CRITICAL findings.**
Ask the advisor to verify: Is the finding real? Could it be a false positive (e.g., SQL parameterization
is present but in a non-obvious form)? The CRITICAL label raises team alarm — it should be correct.

Incorporate advisor feedback. Downgrade to HIGH if advisor identifies a false positive with clear reasoning.

Mark `advisor` completed.

---

### Step 5 — Aggregate and Report

Mark `aggregate` in_progress.

1. **Merge** all agent findings into one array
2. **Deduplicate** (adversarial mode only): findings at `(file + line ± 3)` are the same — keep the highest severity
3. **Filter noise:** Drop findings below `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`. If `FLAG_UNCERTAIN=true` (effort=max), include findings at confidence ≥ 0.55 but append `[?]` to descriptions of any finding below 0.70 confidence.
4. **Sort:** CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW

Mark `aggregate` completed. Report via TaskUpdate: "Hawk: N findings (X critical, Y high, Z medium, W low)"

---

### Step 6 — Output

Mark `report` in_progress.

Print as markdown table:

```
| Severity | Category | File:Line | Description | Fix |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| CRITICAL | security | pkg/repo/query.go:42 | ... | ... |
```

Then: `Hawk found N issues: X critical, Y high, Z medium, W low.`

If `--post-pr`:
- Detect PR number: `gh pr view --json number --jq '.number' 2>/dev/null`
- Detect repo: `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner' 2>/dev/null`
- Get head SHA: `gh pr view <N> --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid'`

If `--post-pr=block`: post everything as one block comment:
  `gh pr review <N> --comment -b "<full findings table>"`

Otherwise (default `--post-pr`):
  For each CRITICAL or HIGH finding, post an inline review comment:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/comments \
    --method POST \
    --field body="**[hawk] SEVERITY — CATEGORY**\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n**Fix:** FIX" \
    --field commit_id="<head SHA>" \
    --field path="FILE" \
    --field line=LINE \
    --field side="RIGHT"
  ```
  Then post MEDIUM/LOW findings (if any) as one block comment:
  `gh pr review <N> --comment -b "<MEDIUM/LOW table only>"`
  If no MEDIUM/LOW findings, skip the block comment entirely.

Mark `report` completed. Report via TaskUpdate: "Hawk: review complete. N issues found."

---

## Finding Schema

```json
{
  "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "category": "architecture|quality|resilience|security",
  "file": "pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go",
  "line": 42,
  "description": "Brief description of the issue",
  "fix": "Concrete actionable fix",
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Review agent(s) completed (no partial results)
- [ ] CRITICAL findings verified by advisor
- [ ] Findings filtered by confidence threshold and ranked
- [ ] Markdown table output with actionable fixes
- [ ] TaskUpdate reported completion to shared task list
- [ ] CRITICAL/HIGH findings posted as inline comments; MEDIUM/LOW as block summary (when --post-pr)
