# Evolve Command

## Status — not currently runnable

**This command is disabled and its implementation path does not exist.** Both invocations
previously documented here pointed at
`continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py`, and there is no `continuous-learning-v2`
skill anywhere in this repo or under `~/.claude/skills` — only `ai/skills/continuous-learning/`,
which ships a `SKILL.md` and no CLI. Any agent that followed those instructions failed.

Corroborating state: `.claude/settings.json` `skillOverrides` sets both `"evolve": "off"` and
`"continuous-learning": "off"`, and `ai/skills/REMOVALS.md` records `evolve` as
`disabled-pending` ("Slash command at ai/commands/evolve.md; no ai/skills/evolve directory
exists to gate").

Do not restore an invocation here without a CLI that exists. If the instincts/evolve pipeline is
revived, the missing pieces are: a real CLI, a signal producer feeding it, and flipping the two
`skillOverrides` entries back on — see the triage note in `plans/` for what was assessed and why
`scripts/learning_signal.py` was judged an orphan producer.

## What it was intended to do

Analyzes instincts and clusters related ones into higher-level structures:
- **Commands**: When instincts describe user-invoked actions
- **Skills**: When instincts describe auto-triggered behaviors
- **Agents**: When instincts describe complex, multi-step processes

## Usage

```
/evolve                    # Analyze all instincts and suggest evolutions
/evolve --generate         # Also generate files under evolved/{skills,commands,agents}
```

## Evolution Rules

### → Command (User-Invoked)
When instincts describe actions a user would explicitly request:
- Multiple instincts about "when user asks to..."
- Instincts with triggers like "when creating a new X"
- Instincts that follow a repeatable sequence

Example:
- `new-table-step1`: "when adding a database table, create migration"
- `new-table-step2`: "when adding a database table, update schema"
- `new-table-step3`: "when adding a database table, regenerate types"

→ Creates: **new-table** command

### → Skill (Auto-Triggered)
When instincts describe behaviors that should happen automatically:
- Pattern-matching triggers
- Error handling responses
- Code style enforcement

Example:
- `prefer-functional`: "when writing functions, prefer functional style"
- `use-immutable`: "when modifying state, use immutable patterns"
- `avoid-classes`: "when designing modules, avoid class-based design"

→ Creates: `functional-patterns` skill

### → Agent (Needs Depth/Isolation)
When instincts describe complex, multi-step processes that benefit from isolation:
- Debugging workflows
- Refactoring sequences
- Research tasks

Example:
- `debug-step1`: "when debugging, first check logs"
- `debug-step2`: "when debugging, isolate the failing component"
- `debug-step3`: "when debugging, create minimal reproduction"
- `debug-step4`: "when debugging, verify fix with test"

→ Creates: **debugger** agent

## What to Do

1. Detect current project context
2. Read project + global instincts (project takes precedence on ID conflicts)
3. Group instincts by trigger/domain patterns
4. Identify:
   - Skill candidates (trigger clusters with 2+ instincts)
   - Command candidates (high-confidence workflow instincts)
   - Agent candidates (larger, high-confidence clusters)
5. Show promotion candidates (project -> global) when applicable
6. If `--generate` is passed, write files to:
   - Project scope: `~/.claude/homunculus/projects/<project-id>/evolved/`
   - Global fallback: `~/.claude/homunculus/evolved/`
